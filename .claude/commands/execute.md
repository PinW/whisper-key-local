PLAN: $ARGUMENTS

If PLAN is file reference
- Think hard and implement $ARGUMENTS

If PLAN is "l"
- Think hard and implement plan with the latest timestamp in `documentation/implementation-plans`

If PLAN is empty
- List files in (ordered by date, descending) in `documentation/implementation-plans` and list for selection (eg. `State Management Update (2025-01-28 12:00)`)
- Then think hard and implement user's selection
