description: Write a user story for the roadmap
---

Write a user story for @documentation/roadmap/roadmap.md following this format:

`- As a *[role]* I want **[feature]** so [benefit]`

Notes:
- For the feature and benefit, be as specific as possible
- If there's a GitHub issue, append (#number) at the end
- Keep it to one line

Examples:
- As a *user* I want **cancel recording action** so I can reset if I mess up
- As a *developer* I want **end-to-end tests** so that I can refactor with confidence
- As a *user* I want **support for more hotkeys** (F13-F24, Insert) so I can use StreamDeck triggers (#14)
