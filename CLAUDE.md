- Run `py-build/builder.py` to build
- DO NOT TEST: we develop in WSL, but the app is run from windows
- Ask the user to test for you if needed
- Don't commit before i test
- Prefer elegant code that is modular and consistent
- We are in ALPHA, don't bother with backward compatibility or too much versioning/testing
