@documentation/project-index.md

- Build: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File /home/pin/whisper-key-local/py-build/build-windows.ps1`
- DO NOT TEST: we develop in WSL, but the app is run from windows
- Ask user to test before committing
- Prefer elegant code that is modular and consistent
- Use clear variable/function names
- Avoid comments unless absolutely necessary
- We are in ALPHA, don't bother with backward compatibility
