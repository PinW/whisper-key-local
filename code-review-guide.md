# Code Review & Cleanup Guide

This branch is dedicated to reading and understanding my own codebase - every component, every interaction, every design decision. While doing so, we'll make the code slightly more elegant and beautiful, worthy of DHH's approval.

## Goals
- **Code comprehension**: Read and understand all components built together
- **Comment cleanup**: Remove redundant comments that restate obvious code
- **Code elegance**: Improve function/variable naming for self-documenting code  
- **Strategic refactoring**: Enhance logic and structure as understanding develops

## Review Instructions
- **Keep responses concise**: Maximum 1-2 paragraphs with optional list
- **Wait for confirmation**: Never write code or move to next component automatically
- **Let user drive**: Always stand by for explicit direction on what to review next

## Components to Review

### Core Application Files
- [ ] `whisper-key.py` - Main application entry point
- [ ] `src/state_manager.py` - Application state coordination
- [ ] `src/audio_recorder.py` - Microphone audio capture
- [ ] `src/whisper_engine.py` - AI speech transcription
- [ ] `src/clipboard_manager.py` - Clipboard operations & auto-paste
- [ ] `src/hotkey_listener.py` - Global hotkey detection
- [ ] `src/config_manager.py` - Configuration management
- [ ] `src/system_tray.py` - System tray interface
- [ ] `src/audio_feedback.py` - Recording sound notifications
- [ ] `src/utils.py` - Common utilities

### Test Suite & Tools
- [ ] Review all test files (`tests/` directory)
- [ ] Review all utility tools (`tools/` directory)

## Completed
- [x] Removed all "For beginners:" comments throughout codebase
- [x] Cleaned up orphaned text fragments left after comment removal
- [x] Refactored main function with consistent setup patterns
- [x] Moved status printing to component constructors for better encapsulation
- [x] Fixed SystemTray availability handling to prevent incomplete objects
- [x] Resolved circular dependency between SystemTray and StateManager
- [x] Made StateManager initialization explicit to show architectural importance
- [x] Moved key_simulation_delay from hotkey config to clipboard config
