# Windows Whisper Speech-to-Text App - Development Plan

## Project Overview

Developing a local implementation of OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text for Windows 10 that:
- Uses the smallest Whisper model (tiny) running locally with CPU
- Runs as a Windows 10 background application
- Provides a global hotkey to start/stop recording
- Automatically pastes voice transcription into active application input

## Recommended Technology Stack

- Production-ready with robust error handling

**Alternative: `openai-whisper`**
- Official OpenAI implementation
- Fallback option if faster-whisper has issues
- Direct compatibility guarantee

**Model Support Strategy:**

2. **Hotkey Conflicts** - Collision with other applications
   - *Mitigation:* Configurable hotkeys and conflict detection
3. **Performance Issues** - CPU usage too high
   - *Mitigation:* faster-whisper and optimization techniques

### User Experience Risks
1. **Complex Setup** - Too many configuration options
   - *Mitigation:* Sensible defaults and simple setup wizard
2. **Accuracy Issues** - Transcription errors
   - *Mitigation:* Clear expectations and model limitations documentation

## Alternative Approaches

### If Python Proves Challenging
1. **Electron + Node.js** - Web technologies, cross-platform
2. **C# .NET** - Native Windows integration, good performance
3. **Go** - Single binary, good performance, simpler deployment

### If Performance is Insufficient
1. **GPU Acceleration** - CUDA support in faster-whisper
2. **Cloud API Fallback** - OpenAI API for complex audio
3. **Streaming Processing** - Real-time transcription chunks

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Iterate** - Refine this plan based on feedback
2. **Environment Setup** - Prepare development environment
3. **Proof of Concept** - Build minimal working version
4. **Iterative Development** - Build and test each component

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Hotkey Preference:** What hotkey combination feels natural?
2. **Recording Behavior:** Toggle recording or hold-to-record?
3. **User Interface:** System tray icon or pure background service?
4. **Error Handling:** How should transcription errors be communicated?
5. **Updates:** Auto-update mechanism or manual updates?
