# Implementation Plans

`/documentation/implementation-plans`: plans for features & improvements

## Purpose

Implementation plans serve as:
- **Step-by-step guides** for complex feature development
- **Progress tracking** with checkboxes and completion notes
- **Documentation** of design decisions and technical approaches
- **Historical records** of how features were implemented

## Plan Format

Each implementation plan should follow this structure:

### Header
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Note: Execute one line-item at a time and confirm with user before proceeding to next**
**Note: Update this document as you go, checking off tasks and taking notes needed for later**
```

### Current State Analysis
- Document existing functionality
- Identify gaps and issues
- Note what's already working

### Implementation Plan
Break down into numbered steps with:
- Clear, actionable tasks
- Checkboxes for tracking progress (`- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for complete)
- After completion, add sub-tasks to each checkbox item with detailed completion notes
- Priority indicators where relevant

### Implementation Details
- Code patterns and examples
- Technical specifications
- Architecture decisions

### Files to Modify
- List all files that need changes
- Brief description of what changes each file needs

## Output Format

Create .md file with descriptive names and timestamps:
- `documentation/implementation-plans/feature-name-implementation-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Example: `state-management-update-2025-01-28.md`

## Progress Tracking

Update the plan as tasks are completed:

**Example:**
```markdown
- [x] Add model_loading state to StateManager
  - ✅ Added `is_model_loading` flag to StateManager class
  - ✅ Updated `toggle_recording()` to check model_loading state
  - ✅ Added `set_model_loading()` method for state management
  - ✅ System tray now shows processing icon during model loading
```
