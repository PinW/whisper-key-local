# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for major features and improvements to the Whisper Speech-to-Text app.

## Purpose

Implementation plans serve as:
- **Step-by-step guides** for complex feature development
- **Progress tracking** with checkboxes and completion notes
- **Documentation** of design decisions and technical approaches
- **Historical records** of how features were implemented

## Plan Format

Each implementation plan should follow this structure:

### Header
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Note: Execute one line-item at a time and confirm with user before proceeding to next**
**Note: Update this document as you go, checking off tasks and taking notes needed for later**
```

### Current State Analysis
- Document existing functionality
- Identify gaps and issues
- Note what's already working

### Implementation Plan
Break down into numbered steps with:
- Clear, actionable tasks
- Checkboxes for tracking progress (`- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for complete)
- After completion, add sub-tasks to each checkbox item with detailed completion notes
- Priority indicators where relevant

### Implementation Details
- Code patterns and examples
- Technical specifications
- Architecture decisions

### Files to Modify
- List all files that need changes
- Brief description of what changes each file needs

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with timestamps:
- `feature-name-implementation-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Example: `state-management-update-2025-01-28.md`

## Usage Workflow

1. **Create** detailed plan with step-by-step tasks
2. **Execute** one task at a time, updating progress as you go
3. **Document** completion details and any discoveries
4. **Archive** completed plans for future reference
