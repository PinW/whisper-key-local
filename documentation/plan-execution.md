Execute the attached implementation plan as written, prioritize correctness over speed

## Execution Instructions
- Create todo list reflecting the tasks in current phase
- Always update progress in the plan file after completing a task
- Always ask for user confirmation before moving to the next phase
- Try not to do more than the scope of tasks listed (avoid working on future phases)

## Example Progress Update
```markdown
- [x] Add model_loading state to StateManager
  - ✅ Added `is_model_loading` flag to StateManager class
  - ✅ Updated `toggle_recording()` to check model_loading state
  - ✅ Added `set_model_loading()` method for state management
  - ✅ System tray now shows processing icon during model loading
```

## When to Stop & Ask
Ask 1 question and stop if:
- Requirements are ambiguous
- Complexity exceeds assumptions
- Task conflicts with success criteria
