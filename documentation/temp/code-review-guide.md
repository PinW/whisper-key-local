# Code Review & Cleanup Guide

This branch is dedicated to reading and understanding my own codebase - every component, every interaction, every design decision. While doing so, we'll make the code slightly more elegant and beautiful, worthy of DHH's approval.

## Goals
- **Code comprehension**: Read and understand all components built together
- **Comment cleanup**: Remove redundant comments that restate obvious code
- **Code elegance**: Improve function/variable naming for self-documenting code  
- **Strategic refactoring**: Enhance logic and structure as understanding develops

## Review Instructions
- **Keep responses concise**: Maximum 1-2 paragraphs with optional list
- **Wait for confirmation**: Never write code or move to next component automatically
- **Let user drive**: Always stand by for explicit direction on what to review next
