# WHISPER KEY - VOICE COMMANDS (EXPERIMENTAL)
# =============================================================================
# Speak a trigger phrase during command mode (Ctrl+G) to run the associated command.
# The "run" field accepts any shell command (cmd.exe on Windows, /bin/sh on macOS).
#
# Matching: triggers are case-insensitive substrings — saying "please open notepad"
# matches the trigger "open notepad". Longer triggers are checked first.
